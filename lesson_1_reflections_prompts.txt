How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It is visually shows a small piece of code, where changed was fixed on certain momentum.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It helps to rewind project in a state, that was before we make a mistake or anything else.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: flexible workflow and control of code. Cons: when automaticly then sometimes it can save a interrupted session work. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

VCS's like GitHub are intent to use in projects that involved a usage of different files which related and work together, while Google Docs are primarly used for texts, where changes in one text file doesn't have much effect to other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log command is used to view all commits, git diff - is to compairing old file with the new one.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because I know that with Git I can always rewind all changes.
